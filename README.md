# SteamCommunity


This is a WORK IN PROGRESS

This directory contains code and results which were part of a 4 week Insight Project. They will be documented in a blog post [here]

It contains the following files:

`Root_User.ipynb` -- This creates the first user and initial files needed to run the API "scraper".

`Scrape_Steam.py` -- This contains the code used to use the steam API on a mass scale, and saves the output into CSV files.
