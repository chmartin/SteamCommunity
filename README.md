This is a WORK IN PROGRESS

This directory contains code and results which were part of a 4 week Insight Project. They will be documented in a blog post [here]

It contains the following files:

`Root_User.ipynb` -- This creates the first user and initial files needed to run the API "scraper".

`Scrape_Steam.py` -- This contains the code used to use the steam API on a mass scale, and saves the output into CSV files.

`Study_games_per_steamid.ipynb` -- This is a jupyter notebook for studying the games per steamid data, creating some summary CSV files.

`Study_per_game.ipynb` -- This is a jupyter notebook for studying the data from a per game perspective, creating some summary CSV files.

`Study_player_info.ipynb` -- This is a jupyter notebook for studying the player profile data, creating some summary CSV files.

`Get_Steam_Pairs.py` -- This contains the code used to obtain the game achievement information for a user, game pairs. It saves the output in multiple CSV files.
